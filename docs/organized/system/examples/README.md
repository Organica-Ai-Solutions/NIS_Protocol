# NIS Protocol Examples

This directory contains a collection of examples that demonstrate the various features and capabilities of the NIS Protocol.

## How to Run the Examples

To run the examples, you will need to have the NIS Protocol application running. If you have not already done so, please follow the instructions in the [Getting Started guide](../getting_started/README.md) to set up and start the application.

Once the application is running, you can run the examples by executing the corresponding Python script. For example, to run the `agi_evolution_demo.py` example, you would run the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
python dev/examples/agi_evolution_demo.py
```
