### Before vs After Examples
```
🐉 BEFORE (v3.1): "A majestic dragon soaring through clouds"
→ "🧮 Physics Visualization: [NIS PHYSICS COMPLIANT] A majestic dragon, 
   physically accurate, obeys conservation laws, realistic lighting with 
   proper optical physics [Verified: Conservation Laws, Materials]"

🐉 AFTER (v3.2): "A majestic dragon soaring through clouds"  
→ "Gemini 2.5 Creative: dragon, artistic, creative, beautiful composition, 
   artistic style"
```
