# NIS Protocol Reference Implementation

This directory contains the reference implementation of the Neuro-Inspired System Protocol.

## Structure

- `/core` - Core protocol implementation
- `/agents` - Agent implementations for each layer
- `/memory` - Memory management system
- `/emotion` - Emotional modulation system
- `/communication` - Inter-agent communication
- `/examples` - Example implementations

## Getting Started

To use the reference implementation:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Import the desired components:
```python
from nis_protocol.core import NISRegistry
from nis_protocol.agents import VisionAgent, MemoryAgent, EmotionAgent
```

3. See the examples directory for sample applications.

## Minimum Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Redis 6.0+
- OpenCV (for vision capabilities)
- FastAPI (for API endpoints)

## Development Status

The reference implementation is currently under development. See the roadmap in the main documentation for details on completion status.
