## 💡 RECOMMENDED APPROACH: USE GPT-4 FOR RESEARCH

Since you have **real GPT-4 working**, you don't need web search APIs for most research tasks!

### LLM Research is Better For:
- ✅ Comprehensive explanations
- ✅ Multi-topic synthesis
- ✅ Technical deep dives
- ✅ Historical context
- ✅ Conceptual analysis
- ✅ Available NOW (no setup needed)

### Web Search is Better For:
- Current news (last 24 hours)
- Specific URLs or sources
- Real-time data (stock prices, weather)
- Recent events GPT-4 hasn't seen
