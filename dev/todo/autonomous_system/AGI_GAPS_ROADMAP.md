# NIS Protocol v4.0 - Closing Critical AGI Gaps

*Roadmap for addressing the five critical gaps between current NIS Protocol and foundational AGI*

## Overview

Based on the analysis of the current NIS Protocol v3.1, five critical gaps have been identified that need to be addressed to achieve foundational AGI capabilities:

1. **True Autonomous Learning** - Beyond supervised learning to curiosity-driven exploration
2. **General Problem Solving** - Beyond physics-constrained domains to arbitrary abstract reasoning  
3. **Causal Understanding** - Beyond correlation to true causal modeling and intervention
4. **Embodied Intelligence** - Grounding in physical or sophisticated simulated environments
5. **Scalable Self-Improvement** - Recursive enhancement of own capabilities

## Gap 1: True Autonomous Learning

### Current State
- BitNet training system provides basic online learning
- Learning is primarily supervised/guided by human-provided examples

        # Causal analysis
        causal_model = await self.causal_discovery.analyze(input_data)
        
        # Abstract reasoning
        reasoning_result = await self.abstract_reasoning.solve(
            input_data, causal_model
        )
        
        # Embodied grounding
        grounded_result = await self.embodiment.ground_in_experience(
            reasoning_result
        )
        
        # Autonomous learning from the experience
        await self.autonomous_learning.learn_from_experience(
            input_data, grounded_result
        )
        
        # Self-improvement based on performance

## Expected Outcomes

Upon completion of this roadmap, the NIS Protocol v4.0 will achieve:

1. **True autonomy** in learning and goal-setting
2. **General intelligence** across arbitrary problem domains
3. **Causal understanding** enabling intervention and control
4. **Embodied cognition** grounded in physical reality
5. **Recursive self-improvement** with safety guarantees

This will represent a significant step toward foundational AGI while maintaining the physics-informed validation and consciousness-driven safety mechanisms that make the NIS Protocol unique.
