## 🎯 **REAL-WORLD IMPACT EXAMPLES**

### **🚀 Before Enhanced Memory**
```
User: "How does the KAN layer work?"
AI: "KAN layers use spline-based activation functions..." (basic explanation)

User: "How does this connect to what we discussed about physics validation?"
AI: "I don't have context about previous physics discussions..." (context lost)
```

### **✨ After Enhanced Memory**
```
User: "How does the KAN layer work?"
AI: "Building on our previous discussion about Laplace transforms and 
     the PINN physics validation you asked about last week, KAN layers 
     use spline-based activation functions φ(x) = Σᵢ cᵢ Bᵢ(x) where..."

User: "How does this connect to what we discussed about physics validation?"
AI: "Perfect connection! As we established in our PINN discussion, the 
     physics validation layer receives KAN outputs and validates them 
     against conservation laws using the loss function L_physics = 
     ||∇·F - ρ||² + ||∂u/∂t + u·∇u + ∇p||²..."
```

**🎯 Impact:** Deep, contextual conversations that build knowledge over time rather than starting fresh each time.
