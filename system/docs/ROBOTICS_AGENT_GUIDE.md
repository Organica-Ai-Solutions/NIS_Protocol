## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The NIS Protocol Robotics Agent is a **universal translator for robotic systems**, using physics as the common language. It can control drones, humanoid robots (droids), robotic manipulators, and ground vehicles through a unified interface.

### **Key Capabilities**

âœ… **Forward Kinematics** - Joint angles â†’ End effector pose  
âœ… **Inverse Kinematics** - Desired pose â†’ Joint angles  
âœ… **Trajectory Planning** - Physics-validated smooth paths  
âœ… **Platform Translation** - MAVLink â†” ROS â†” Custom protocols  
âœ… **Real-Time Physics Validation** - PINN-based safety checks  
âœ… **Multi-Robot Coordination** - Unified control interface
