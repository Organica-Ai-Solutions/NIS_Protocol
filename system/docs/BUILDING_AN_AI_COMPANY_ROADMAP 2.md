## 🚧 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Building Too Much Too Fast**
❌ Don't build the entire platform at once  
✅ Start with ONE domain, ONE use case, ONE customer segment

### 2. **Ignoring Product-Market Fit**
❌ Don't scale before finding PMF  
✅ Talk to customers daily, iterate weekly

### 3. **Premature Optimization**
❌ Don't optimize before you have users  
✅ Build fast, measure, then optimize

### 4. **Hiring Too Early**
❌ Don't hire a big team too soon  
✅ Founders should build v1 themselves

### 5. **Copying Competitors**
❌ Don't build what others already do  
✅ Find your unique angle (like NIS's physics validation)

### 6. **Neglecting Infrastructure**
❌ Don't skip testing, monitoring, security  
✅ Build production-ready from day one

### 7. **Forgetting Sales**
❌ Don't assume "if you build it, they will come"  
✅ Invest in sales & marketing early

### 8. **Burning Out**
❌ Don't work 100 hours/week indefinitely  
✅ Sustainable pace wins the marathon
