# Neuro-Inspired System Protocol (NIS Protocol)

![NIS Protocol Logo](assets/images/nis-protocol-logo.png)

The Neuro-Inspired System Protocol (NIS Protocol) is a biologically inspired framework for designing intelligent multi-agent systems. Drawing on the structure and function of the human brain, this protocol integrates perception, memory, emotional weighting, reasoning, and action into a cohesive architecture, enabling more adaptive and naturally intelligent systems.

## üß† Key Features

- **Layered Cognitive Architecture**: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing
- **Emotional State System**: Dynamic modulation of agent behavior through emotional dimensions
- **Memory Integration**: Short and long-term memory for context-aware decision making
- **Standardized Messaging**: Consistent message format for inter-agent communication
- **Biologically Inspired Learning**: Continuous adaptation based on experience

## üîß Installation

To install the NIS Protocol framework:

```bash
pip install nis-protocol
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```python
from nis_protocol import NISRegistry, NISAgent, NISLayer

# Create a registry
registry = NISRegistry()

# Define a simple agent
class MyPerceptionAgent(NISAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            agent_id="my_perception_agent",
            layer=NISLayer.PERCEPTION,
            description="A simple perception agent"
        )
    
    def process(self, message):
        # Process incoming data
        # ...
        return processed_data

# Register the agent
agent = MyPerceptionAgent()

# Start processing
registry.start()
```

## üìä Application Examples

The NIS Protocol can be applied to various domains:

![Usage Examples](assets/images/usesExamples.png)

- **Autonomous Systems**: Robotics, drones, self-driving vehicles
- **Smart Infrastructure**: Traffic management, energy distribution
- **Security Applications**: Surveillance, fraud detection
- **Healthcare**: Patient monitoring with adaptive priorities
- **Customer Interaction**: Context-aware support systems

## üåü Emotional State System

The emotional state system modulates agent behavior based on context-sensitive dimensions:

Key emotional dimensions include:
- **Suspicion**: Increases scrutiny for unusual patterns
- **Urgency**: Prioritizes time-sensitive processing
- **Confidence**: Adjusts decision-making thresholds
- **Interest**: Directs focus to specific features
- **Novelty**: Highlights deviations from expectations
