## Meta Protocol Capabilities

The NIS Protocol serves as a universal meta-protocol for AI agent communication, offering:

1. **Protocol Translation**
   - Seamless translation between different AI protocols
   - Preservation of semantic meaning and context
   - Emotional state mapping across protocols
   - Memory context sharing

2. **Cognitive Enhancement**
   - Addition of emotional intelligence to existing protocols
   - Memory integration for context preservation
   - Learning capabilities for protocol optimization
   - Adaptive routing based on conversation context

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Real-time protocol metrics tracking
   - Latency and error rate monitoring
   - Automatic scaling based on load
   - Alert system for performance issues

4. **Security & Compliance**
   - End-to-end encryption support
   - Rate limiting and access control
   - Protocol validation and sanitization
   - Audit logging for all translations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NIS-Protocol.git
   cd NIS-Protocol
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the system:
   - Copy `config/protocol_config.example.json` to `config/protocol_config.json`
   - Update the configuration with your API keys and endpoints
   - Set up environment variables in `.env`

## Usage

1. Initialize the Meta Protocol:
   ```python
   from src.meta import MetaProtocolCoordinator
   from src.adapters import MCPAdapter, ACPAdapter, A2AAdapter
   
   # Create coordinator
   coordinator = MetaProtocolCoordinator()
   
   # Register protocols
   coordinator.register_protocol("mcp", MCPAdapter())
   coordinator.register_protocol("acp", ACPAdapter())
   coordinator.register_protocol("a2a", A2AAdapter())
   
   # Route message between protocols
   response = await coordinator.route_message(
       source_protocol="mcp",
       target_protocol="a2a",
       message={
           "content": "Hello from MCP!",
           "metadata": {"priority": "HIGH"}
       }
   )
   ```

2. Monitor Protocol Performance:
   ```python
   # Get protocol metrics
   mcp_metrics = coordinator.get_protocol_metrics("mcp")
   print(f"MCP Success Rate: {mcp_metrics.successful_translations / mcp_metrics.total_messages}")
   ```

## Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture inspired by neural processing:

1. **Sensory Layer**
   - Handles input processing (text, data)
   - Performs initial tokenization and formatting

2. **Perception Layer**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Feature extraction
   - Initial interpretation

3. **Memory Layer**
   - Working memory management
   - Long-term storage
   - Memory consolidation
   - Semantic search

4. **Emotional Layer**
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Emotional state tracking
   - Affective processing

5. **Executive Layer**
   - Decision making
   - Action planning
   - Goal management

6. **Motor Layer**
   - Action execution
   - Output generation
   - Protocol handling
