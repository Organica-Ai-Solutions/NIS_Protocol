# NIS Protocol v3.1

The NIS Protocol (Neural Integration System Protocol) is a structured framework for developing, testing, and deploying agent-based systems for generative simulation.

## ðŸ“‹ Important Repository Note
This repository uses Git LFS (Large File Storage) for managing large model files. If you're cloning this repository, please make sure you have Git LFS installed:

```bash
# Install Git LFS
git lfs install

# Clone with LFS support
git lfs clone https://github.com/Organica-Ai-Solutions/NIS_Protocol.git
```

The actual large model files (located in `models/bitnet/`) are not included directly in the repository. See `models/bitnet/README.md` for instructions on downloading these files.

**The NIS Protocol is a generative AI system that builds and runs physically-informed simulations. Based on a descriptive prompt, the system can generate a 3D model, simulate its performance under specified conditions, and produce a technical report on its viability (see `benchmarks/performance_validation.py` for validation).**

This is a closed-loop design and validation system that connects generative AI to a "world model" grounded in physical principles, allowing it to create and test systematic designs.

| **Verifiable AI Pipeline**    | The Laplace â†’ KAN â†’ PINN pipeline, supported by NVIDIA Modulus, ensures that generated content is grounded in scientific principles (validated in `benchmarks/performance_validation.py`). | ![Verifiable AI Pipeline](assets/images_organized/mathematical_visuals/laplace+kan.png)                      |
| **Offline-First Capabilities** | The integrated BitNet model allows for fast, offline inference, enabling the system to operate without constant cloud connectivity.     | ![BitNet Integration](assets/images_organized/mathematical_visuals/mlp.png)                                |
| **Multi-Agent Architecture**  | A hierarchy of specialized agents work in coordination to design, simulate, analyze, and learn (see `system/docs/architecture/Agent_Architecture.md`).                                   | ![Agent Architecture](system/docs/diagrams/agent_hierarchy/communication_hierarchy.md)                      |

## System Architecture

The NIS Protocol is built on a hierarchical system of specialized agents that work together to achieve complex goals. This architecture promotes a clear separation of concerns, efficient communication, and a scalable system.

## The NIS Protocol v3.1: A New Paradigm

Version 3.1 represents a significant step forward, moving from a theoretical framework to a functional, production-ready system with well-defined capabilities.

- **From Theory to Implementation**: Where v3 laid the groundwork, v3.1 provides a working implementation. The Generative Simulation Engine is an operational feature.
- **Offline and Autonomous Operation**: The integration of the BitNet model provides a new level of autonomy, allowing the system to learn and operate without constant cloud connectivity.
- **Verifiable and Trustworthy by Design**: The PINN-based validation ensures that the system's outputs are scientifically sound and traceable to first principles.

The NIS Protocol v3.1 is an evolution in what is possible with generative AI, with a strong focus on verifiable and trustworthy results.
