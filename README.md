</div>

## Overview

The Neuro-Inspired System Protocol (NIS Protocol) introduces a biologically inspired framework for designing intelligent multi-agent systems. Drawing from the structure and function of the human brain, this protocol integrates perception, memory, emotional weighting, reasoning, and action into modular agents designed for real-time automation environments â€” such as tolling systems, surveillance, and smart infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Biologically Plausible Architecture**: Mimics proven cognitive structures found in the brain
- **Emotional Modulation**: Includes priority and suspicion weighting for more human-like decision-making
- **Memory Integration**: Uses short and long-term memory systems to influence contextual decisions
- **Modular Agent Design**: Each cognitive function is implemented as a specialized agent
- **Adaptive Learning**: System improves over time through feedback loops and neuroplasticity

## Protocol Layers

| Layer | Biological Analogy | AI Role |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| Perception | Visual Cortex | Processes sensory inputs (images, text, data streams) |
| Memory | Hippocampus | Stores and retrieves historical data |
| Emotion | Amygdala | Modulates priority and suspicion |
| Reasoning | Prefrontal Cortex | Synthesizes inputs into decisions |
| Action | Motor Cortex | Executes system actions |
| Learning | Neuroplasticity | Adjusts weights and policies |

## Use Cases

- **Automated Tolling Systems**
- **Smart City Infrastructure**
- **Security and Surveillance**
- **Traffic Management**
- **Healthcare Monitoring**
- **Financial Fraud Detection**

## Repository Structure

- `/architecture` - Detailed design documents
