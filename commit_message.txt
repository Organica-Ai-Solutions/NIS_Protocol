feat(v3.1): Complete NIS Protocol v3.1 with Docker support and enhanced endpoints

This commit finalizes the NIS Protocol v3.1 with the following improvements:

- Added Docker containerization with multi-service architecture
- Enhanced API endpoints for agent communication
- Fixed simulation agent to properly calculate results based on input parameters
- Added comprehensive Postman collection for API testing
- Updated environment template for easier configuration
- Implemented proper error handling and logging
- Added health check and monitoring endpoints
- Ensured all calculations follow NIS Protocol Engineering Integrity Rules

The system now runs successfully in Docker with most endpoints functioning correctly. 
Some specific agent endpoints still need further debugging but the core system is operational.

This version serves as a stable checkpoint for NIS Protocol v3.1.
