## üéØ **REAL-WORLD IMPACT EXAMPLES**

### **üöÄ SPACE EXPLORATION SCENARIO:**
**CLAIM:** "95% accurate trajectory calculations"  
**REALITY CHECK:** If actually 85% accurate:
- **RESULT:** Spacecraft misses Mars by 50,000 km
- **CONSEQUENCE:** Crew dies in deep space
- **LESSON:** Every percentage point matters when lives are at stake

### **üè• MEDICAL AI SCENARIO:**
**CLAIM:** "Advanced diagnostic capabilities"  
**REALITY CHECK:** If "advanced" means 70% accuracy:
- **RESULT:** 30% misdiagnosis rate
- **CONSEQUENCE:** Patients receive wrong treatment, some die
