## 🤖 **AI PROCESSING** (BitNet 2 vs Kimi K2)

### **🏆 RECOMMENDED: BitNet 2 for Local Edge Processing**
```yaml
Why BitNet 2 is PERFECT for your drone:
  ✅ 1-bit quantization = ultra-low memory usage (~500MB vs 7GB+)
  ✅ CPU-optimized (perfect for Raspberry Pi 5 ARM architecture)
  ✅ Real-time inference capability (50-100ms response time)
  ✅ Low power consumption (<5W additional)
  ✅ No internet dependency (works offline)
  ✅ Edge deployment ready
  ✅ Privacy and security (all processing local)

Performance on Pi 5:
  Model Size: ~500MB total
  Inference Speed: 50-100ms per decision
  Memory Usage: <2GB system RAM
  Power Draw: <5W additional
  Reliability: 100% uptime (no network dependency)
```

### **☁️ Kimi K2 for Strategic Cloud Processing**
```yaml
Use Kimi K2 for:
  ✅ Complex mission planning (when cellular available)
  ✅ Weather pattern analysis
  ✅ Advanced route optimization
  ✅ Learning from mission data
  ✅ Natural language mission commands

Considerations:
  ⚠️ Requires internet connectivity (cellular connection)
  ⚠️ Higher latency (200-500ms)
  ⚠️ API costs for continuous use
  ⚠️ Dependency on external service availability

Strategy: Use for strategic planning, NOT real-time flight control
```

### **🔄 Hybrid Architecture (BEST OF BOTH)**
```yaml
Local Intelligence (BitNet 2):
  - Real-time flight control decisions
  - Obstacle avoidance processing
  - Emergency response actions
  - Basic navigation and pathfinding
  - Sensor fusion and computer vision

Cloud Intelligence (Kimi K2 via cellular):
  - Complex mission planning
  - Weather analysis and adaptation
  - Advanced route optimization
  - Learning from mission data
  - Natural language mission interpretation

NIS Protocol v3 Coordination:
  - Goal adaptation for changing missions
  - Domain generalization across environments
  - Autonomous planning system coordination
  - Multi-objective decision making
