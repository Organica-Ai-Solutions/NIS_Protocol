# Block vulnerable keras versions (CVE-2024-55459)
# keras 2.15.0 has 2 high-severity vulnerabilities:
# - GHSA-cjgq-5qmw-rcj6
# - GHSA-36fq-jgmw-4r9c (fixed in 3.11.0)
# Solution: Use tf-keras instead (included in tensorflow 2.15.1)
# Note: We exclude keras entirely to avoid conflicts with tensorflow 2.15.1
# keras>=3.11.0  # Commented out - conflicts with tf 2.15.1

# Ensure minimum secure versions (stable releases)
